\begin{frame}{Big Idea}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Don't give your presentation to \emph{me}
    \item Explain why what you're doing matters to a lay person
    \item I will have science writer from NASA
    \item If she's confused, you'll get a worse grade
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Data}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Okay, you've explained why this is a good idea
    \item Now explain why the data you have helps you show that it works
    \item Give examples of your data, and what your system should do
    \item (Can interleave in the explanation of why)
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What you did}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Keep this short}
    \item Most people spend too much time
    \item Don't talk about data processing, formatting, etc.
    \item Important and takes time, but not worth talking about
    \item Make it clear what each group member did (but do so briefly)
    \item Give contribution of project
      \begin{itemize}
        \item New model?
        \item Different data?
        \item Something else?
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Does it Work}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Give baseline of what a good system should do
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Existing system
        \item Most frequent class
        \item Human performance
      \end{itemize}
    \item Show what your system does
    \item If difference is small, error bars can help
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What if Things Don't Work}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Focus on simple models \only<2>{(I told you so)}
    \item Explain what you'll do between now and final report (due on finals day)
    \item Try to have results thus far
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Don't go over time!}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item 12 minutes per project
    \item 1 minute for questions
    \item Don't leave important things toward end to be rushed
    \item Will be very strict with time!
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Writeup}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item NIPS or ACL format
    \item Due on day of final (May 8), 19:30 Mountain
    \item Submit via e-mail to me and Alvin
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}
