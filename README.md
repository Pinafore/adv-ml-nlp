You'll propose what you're going to talk about two weeks before your presentation and get feedback in person from the class.

You'll then give an expanded outline on Piazza.  (Remember to include your github ID so we can add you to this repository.)

If you generate slides, please use either Beamer or markdown.  Include a Makefile that by default generates everything necessary (it's fine to generate material from a Python/Ruby/Julia/Perl script, just make sure that's part of the Makefile).

Create a new directory for either your presentation/mathematical treatment and include all material needed for your Makefile to generate your results.
